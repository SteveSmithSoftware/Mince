# Mince

A GUI Toolkit for use with the Beef Programming Language

The end game is to have a toolkit very similar in usage to Win Forms. This project is still very much in the proof of concept/design/development stage so anything can and will change at a moments notice.

Tools so far :-

    Panel - Base display surface
    Button - Click and Go
    Text - Winforms equivalent of Label
    TextBox - Editabale Text field
    CheckBox - An On/Off switch
    RadioGroup - Select one of many RadioButtons
    ListView - Scrollable Text Panel
    ListBox - Selectable ListView
    DropDown - Popup ListBox
    
    See MinceTest for an example of usage.
